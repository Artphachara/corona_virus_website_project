# Corona Virus Website Project (2nd Year)
This project involved creating a website to provide information about the coronavirus, utilizing technologies like HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. The website features various functionalities to display data and raise awareness.

# Reflection:
During this project, I learned the importance of organizing files into structured folders for CSS, HTML, PHP, and other resources. Without this organization, managing and locating files in larger projects becomes challenging. This realization has shaped my approach to project organization in subsequent work.
